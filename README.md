# Mapper Interactive


The Mapper algorithm is a method for topological data analysis first proposed by Gurjeet Singh, Facundo Mémoli and Gunnar Carlsson in 2007 [^1]. 
Mapper Interactive is a web-based visualization tool for high-dimensional data analysis build upon the Mapper algorithm. It is an open source software and is released under the MIT License.

## Installation

Prebuilt Blocks
====================

Blocks define regions on the right-hand pane of the page. These include things like data loaders, mapper configurations, coloring selectors, and data viewers.

Currently implemented blocks can be found at `static/modules/blocks <https://github.com/MapperInteractive/MapperInteractive/static/modules/blocks>`_. These include

- :code:`ColorFunction`
- :code:`FixedDataLoader`
- :code:`FormDataLoader`
- :code:`LinearRegression`
- :code:`SizeFunctions`

Read about how to customize these blocks or construct your own block at :ref:`Blocks`.

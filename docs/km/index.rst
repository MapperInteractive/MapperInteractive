Kepler Mapper Interactive
------------------------------

We provide off-the-shelf configuration for using Kepler Mapper as the Mapper construction engine. The only customization required is to load the data and pass it to the `KeplerMapperConf` object. 

Following the :ref:`Getting Started Guide` to initialize the basic setup, see the :ref:`KM Configuration` page for more advanced customization, or see :ref:`Configurations` page to learn how to extend the Mapper Interactive framework for yourself.
